# CoreDataExample

This project was born out of a simple necessaty.
I needed a Core Data Getting started projectm updated to iOS 10 in Objective C and just couln't find one.
So, I've created one of my own and now I'm sharing it with you.

## What this project can do
This project contains a Table View that contains data that added into Core Data.
It take advantage of the tightly coupled link between the Core Data services as the Model and the Table View as the controller.

This project shows how to add data into the Core Data service.

That's it!
This way you can see exactly what is absolutly necessary to implement Core Data service and save data.

Updates will come...
